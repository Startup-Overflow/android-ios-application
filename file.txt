1.Growth investments

These are more suitable for long term investors that are willing and able to withstand market ups and downs.

Shares are considered a growth investment as they can help grow the value of your original investment over the medium to long term.

Property is also considered as a growth investment because the price of houses and other properties can rise substantially over a medium to long term period.

These are more focused on consistently generating income, rather than growth, and are considered lower risk than growth investments.

Cash investments include everyday bank accounts, high interest savings accounts and term deposits.

Property is also considered as a growth investment because the price of houses and other properties can rise substantially over a medium to long term period.

4.Defensive investments

These are more focused on consistently generating income, rather than growth, and are considered lower risk than growth investments.

Cash investments include everyday bank accounts, high interest savings accounts and term deposits.

Shares are considered a growth investment as they can help grow the value of your original investment over the medium to long term.

3.Property

Property is also considered as a growth investment because the price of houses and other properties can rise substantially over a medium to long term period.

4.Defensive investments

These are more focused on consistently generating income, rather than growth, and are considered lower risk than growth investments.

5.Cash

Cash investments include everyday bank accounts, high interest savings accounts and term deposits.
